Run and debug tests locally
===========================
In this how-to, we will go through how to locally execute and debug charm tests. Specifically, we will test one endpoint from one charm, which is the primary charm being tested and is called the target charm, with one endpoint from one other charm, which we call the neighbor charm.

Note that the steps below are the same used for executing charm tests in the charm integration testing project.

Information you will need
-------------------------
This guide will reference variables that need to contain values specific to your use case. For convenience, they are treated as environment variables, so that you can simply copy and paste the commands as they are written (without any edits or substitutions), as long as you set the environment variables yourself beforehand. However, you may also substitute values directly into the commands if you prefer not to set environment variables.

``TARGET_CHARM``:
  The name of the primary charm under test on `Charmhub <https://charmhub.io/>`_. For example, ``grafana-k8s``.
``TARGET_ENDPOINT``:
  Endpoint of the charm being tested. For example, ``grafana-dashboard``.
``NEIGHBOR_CHARM``:
  The name on `Charmhub <https://charmhub.io/>`_ of the charm to test the primary charm against. For example, ``loki-k8s``.
``NEIGHBOR_ENDPOINT``:
  Endpoint for the neighbor charm being tested. For example, ``grafana-dashboard``.
``REVISION``:
  Revision number of the charm under test. For our example, ``143``.
``SERIES``:
  Series to run the charm tests under. This is one of ``20.04``, ``22.04`` and ``24.04``.
``SUBSTRATE``:
  Substrate to run the tests on. The only possible value at the moment is ``kubernetes``.
``K8S_CLOUD_NAME``:
  The name to use for the Kubernetes cloud that Juju will use for its controller and model. For example, ``k8s-cloud``.
``K8S_CONTROLLER_NAME``:
  The name to use for the Juju controller that is bootstrapped to the Kubernetes cloud and which will control the Juju model used in the testing. For example, ``k8s-controller``.
``MODEL_NAME``:
  The name to use for the Juju model that is created and used in the testing. For example, ``charm-testing``.
``OUTPUT_FILE``:
  A filename to use for for the charm bundle output produced by the ``build-bundle.sh`` script. For example, ``generated-bundle.yaml``.

Optional environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following environment variables are optional and only needed when testing specific charms that require them:

``MINIO_CLIENT_FILE``:
  Path to the MinIO client configuration file. Will be downloaded automatically by the test scripts if not provided. Used when deploying the `minio-k8s` charm with `s3-integrator`.
``UBUNTU_PRO_TOKEN``:
  Ubuntu Pro token for configuring the livepatch server. Required when testing the `canonical-livepatch-server-k8s`` charms.
``VALIDATORS_PATH``:
  Path to a local directory containing the validator packages (each a sub-directory with its own ``pyproject.toml``). When set, the test framework will SCP the directory to each unit under test, install the validators in a virtualenv, and run them after each validation phase. If not provided, validator injection is skipped. For example, ``${PWD}/validators``.

Set up Juju and k8s
-------------------
Juju and k8s will be needed to run the tests.

To install Juju, run:

.. code:: bash

  sudo snap install juju

To install ``k8s`` and ``kubectl``, run:

.. code:: bash

   sudo snap install k8s --classic --channel latest/edge
   sudo snap install kubectl --classic --channel 1.30

Next, bootstrap ``k8s`` and configure ``kubectl``:

.. code:: bash

   sudo k8s bootstrap --address=127.0.0.1
   sudo k8s config > ~/.kube/config

Set up the k8s cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also needed to setup the k8s cloud in juju. Do this with the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   juju add-k8s ${K8S_CLOUD_NAME} --client
   juju bootstrap k8s ${K8S-CONTROLLER} --bootstrap-constraints root-disk=5G
   juju add-model ${MODEL_NAME} \
    --config "logging-config=DEBUG" \
    --config="update-status-hook-interval=2m"

Install the repository dependencies
-----------------------------------

Next, install the Python dependencies to run the repository code:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install pipx
   pipx install poetry==2.0
   poetry install

Generate dynamic bundles
------------------------

To run the tests, we will generate a dynamic bundle that includes our test charm, the neighbor charm, and their respective endpoints. Do this with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   ./scripts/build-bundle.sh \
    --charms \
      "target::${TARGET_CHARM}::${CHANNEL}::${REVISION}::${SERIES}" \
      "neighbor::${NEIGHBOR_CHARM}::default::default::default" \
    --integrations "target:${TARGET_ENDPOINT}::neighbor:${NEIGHBOR_ENDPOINT}" \
    --substrate "${SUBSTRATE}" \
    --charm-metadata-overrides ./static/charm-metadata-overrides/ \
    --charm-platform-overrides ./static/charm-platform-overrides/ \
    --charm-listing-overrides ./static/charm-listing-overrides.yaml \
    --charm-test-configs ./static/charm-test-configs/ \
    --output-file "${OUTPUT_FILE}"

The contents of the output file will look something like the following:

.. code:: yaml

  applications:
    neighbor:
      base: ubuntu@20.04
      channel: 1/stable
      charm: loki-k8s
      revision: 194
      scale: 1
      trust: true
    target:
      base: ubuntu@20.04
      channel: 1/stable
      charm: grafana-k8s
      revision: 143
      scale: 1
      trust: true
  bundle: kubernetes
  relations:
  - - neighbor:grafana-dashboard
    - target:grafana-dashboard

Run tests
---------

Run all tests with the following command. The state-driven scheduler
automatically handles deploy, integration tests, and teardown in the
correct order:

.. code:: bash

   ./scripts/run-tests.sh \
     --model "${MODEL_NAME}" \
     --current-state "empty_model" \
     --bundles "${OUTPUT_FILE}" \
     --target-application "target" \
     --target-endpoint "${TARGET_ENDPOINT}" \
     --neighbor-application "neighbor" \
     --neighbor-endpoint "${NEIGHBOR_ENDPOINT}"

The ``--current-state`` option tells the scheduler the current state of
the environment so it knows which setup steps (if any) still need to run:

- ``no_controller`` — no Juju controller exists yet (default)
- ``empty_model`` — controller and model are ready but nothing is deployed
- ``deployed`` — the charm bundle is already deployed; skip straight to
  integration tests and teardown
- ``neighbor_only`` — only the neighbor application remains after teardown

Use a non-default ``--current-state`` when resuming a partial run or
iterating locally against an already-deployed model to avoid re-running
expensive setup transitions.
